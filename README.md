# Summary 
Hello, my name is Kenny, and I'm a junior at Brockton High Shool. 
After high school, i jplan on going to college for some field of engineering - though I'm still debating which one i want to go into. 

Outside of school i do a few different things. I like to play videogames, mainly FPS (first person shooters) and games like Minecraft. In season, i like to be in the ice rink either working on my skills or playing in a game. Out of season however, i like to play basketball outside with my freinds, though I'm not very good at it. 

When it comes to Tv shows and sports, I like a lot of things. I tend to watch a lot of Netflix and YouTube, but I'll watch football and hockey when they're on. My favorute shows are Arrow and Flash at the moment, and teams are out own home Boston teams!

# Family
When it comes to family, I think it's the most imprtant thing in life. My family works hard to keep us sustained and in a good place to be able to do a lot of things that we want. 

My family consists of both my mother and father, my younger brother Matthew who is a sophomore at BHS, and my rottweiler Bruin. My father is a metal fabricator and he makes parts for different government projects, and my mother works with State Street Bank - though I'm not sure exactly what she does. :/

Some of my favorite games consist of; Mineraft, Rainbow Six Siege, ARK Survival Evolved, Call of Duty Franchise, and GTA V.

I've been playing games since i was little, and I grew up around Call of Duty. Since then, I've tried playing a handful of different games, and I've grown on to just about anything that has good gameplay and story to it. I like to think that I've become good at FPS's though I'm not pro level. I play most;y to have fun and spend time with friends. 

To be fully honest, gaming is the easiest pass time for me, and I want to be able to keep playing as long as I can get all of my school tasks out of thr way first. School always comes before games, no matter what. 

# After High School
After high school, I want to go into enigineering. I don't really knwo what field, but right now I'm leaning toward mechanical. For a school, I'm looking close to home, mostly at one of the UMass schools. 

I'm curious to see where I go, and how things end up after high school. I don't want to be like some people who don't have a clue on what they want to do when they're out.
